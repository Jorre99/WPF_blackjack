# WPF_BlackJack
This is a WPF application that I built for a class project. It uses the MVVM approach with a Azure SQL database. It is my first WPF app and I am quite thrilled with how it turned out. There are additional features I would like to add to the program, but time constraints have made it so I leave off here for the time being. This was a labor of love and took a fair amount of time to put together, and I couldn't be happier with how it came out. Anyways, I hope you enjoy the project, and can improve upon it.
